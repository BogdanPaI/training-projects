# training-projects

Here I post the code that I write as a **training**. 
Before that, its implementation is being tested, but bugs may occur and its style may not be perfect
(its definitely not perfect:)).

### Sorting algorithms (using arrays)
* [Selection sort](https://github.com/BogdanPal1/training-projects/blob/master/sorting_algorithms/SelectionSort.h)
* [Insertion sort](https://github.com/BogdanPal1/training-projects/blob/master/sorting_algorithms/InsertionSort.h)
* [Merge sort](https://github.com/BogdanPal1/training-projects/blob/master/sorting_algorithms/MergeSort.h)

### Searching algorithms (using arrays)
* [Linear search](https://github.com/BogdanPal1/training-projects/blob/master/searching_algorithms/LinearSearch.h)
* [Binary search (iterative)](https://github.com/BogdanPal1/training-projects/searching_algorithms/BinarySearch(iterative).h)
