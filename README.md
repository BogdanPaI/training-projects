# training-projects

Here I post the code that I write as a **training**. 
Before that, its implementation is being tested, but bugs may occur and its style may not be perfect
(its definitely not perfect:)).

### Sorting algorithms
* [Selection sort (using array)](https://github.com/BogdanPal1/training-projects/blob/master/sorting_algorithms/SelectionSort.h)
* [Insertion sort (using array)](https://github.com/BogdanPal1/training-projects/blob/master/sorting_algorithms/InsertionSort.h)
* [Merge sort (using array)](https://github.com/BogdanPal1/training-projects/blob/master/sorting_algorithms/MergeSort.h)
* [Quicksort (using array)](https://github.com/BogdanPal1/training-projects/blob/master/sorting_algorithms/QuickSort.h)

### Searching algorithms
* [Linear search (using array)](https://github.com/BogdanPal1/training-projects/blob/master/searching_algorithms/LinearSearch.h)
* [Binary search (iterative and using array)](https://github.com/BogdanPal1/training-projects/blob/master/searching_algorithms/BinarySearch(iterative).h)

### Data structures
* [Stack](https://github.com/BogdanPal1/training-projects/blob/master/data_structures/Stack/Stack.h)
* [Queue](https://github.com/BogdanPal1/training-projects/blob/master/data_structures/Queue/Queue.h)
* [Singly linked list](https://github.com/BogdanPal1/training-projects/tree/master/data_structures/LinkedList)
